# Cloud API requirement
> The data of each site is saved in cloud backend, which is isolated by site-id, so for each cloud API, site-id will be part of the HTTP request to cloud API.

> **/sites/{site-id}/api/{version}** is fixed for a specific site.

APIs:

Objects:
- [Sites](./sites.md)
> Operations for site object itself

Features:
- [Dashboard](./dashboard.md)
